## Batch Generation Tips

When generating these images with DALL-E:

1. Try to generate images in batches with consistent prompting
2. Keep the same pastel background color scheme throughout
3. Save all images in PNG format with transparent backgrounds
4. Name files consistently (e.g., `week_05_sesame_seed.png`)
5. Review for consistency in style, scale, and quality

## Post-Processing Steps

After generating all images:

1. Verify and edit transparency if needed
2. Ensure consistent sizing relative to each other
3. Optimize file sizes for mobile app use
4. Create thumbnail versions for timeline cards
