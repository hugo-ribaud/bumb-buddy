# Active Context: BumpBuddy

_Version: 1.5_
_Created: 2025-05-06_
_Last Updated: 2025-01-27_

## Current Focus

**Production Cleanup and Optimization - COMPLETED**: Successfully completed comprehensive production cleanup of the BumpBuddy app. Removed all debug code, test data, and development artifacts. Fixed component architecture issues including ThemeToggle component refactoring to use modern PreferencesContext. The app is now production-ready with clean, optimized code.

**Timeline UI Enhancement - COMPLETED**: Successfully improved the TimelineScreen user interface by replacing the week number circles with fetal size images. This creates a more visually appealing timeline while saving space by removing the separate FetalSizeComparison component from timeline cards. Users can now see the fetal size images directly in the week circles, with the detailed information available when they open the week details page.

**Translation System Enhancement for Supabase Data - FULLY COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented comprehensive translation support for all data fetched from Supabase. The app now has a complete i18n infrastructure with support for English, Spanish, and French, including both UI elements and database content. All components are language-aware and automatically refetch data when the user switches languages. **ALL 40 pregnancy weeks now have complete translations in Spanish and French**, and the service has been fixed to handle missing translations gracefully with proper fallback to English.

**Next Priority: App Store Preparation and Deployment**: With the app now production-ready, focus is shifting to app store preparation, final testing, and deployment processes.

**Health Tracker Feature Temporarily Disabled**: The health tracker feature has been temporarily removed from the navigation for the v1.0 release to simplify the initial launch. The code files are preserved for future implementation as a potential premium feature.

## Recent Decisions

- Successfully implemented language-aware Redux slices for fetalSizeSlice and timelineSlice
- Updated all major components (HomeScreen, WeekDetailScreen, TimelineScreen) to use language from LanguageContext
- Ensured automatic data refetch when user changes language preference
- Maintained proper fallback to English when translations are missing
- FoodGuideScreen was already properly implemented with language support
- All database content (pregnancy weeks, fetal size comparisons, food data) now properly translates

## Current Challenges

- ✅ **Database content translation**: RESOLVED - All content from Supabase now supports translations
- ✅ **Translation mechanism for dynamic content**: RESOLVED - Services and Redux slices are language-aware
- ✅ **Inconsistent user experience**: RESOLVED - UI and content both translate properly
- ✅ **Multilingual database schema**: RESOLVED - Translation tables implemented and working
- ✅ **Service layer language awareness**: RESOLVED - All services consider user's language preference

## Translation System Status - COMPLETED ✅

### 1. Pregnancy Week Content ✅

- All fields (`fetal_development`, `maternal_changes`, `tips`, `nutrition_advice`, `common_symptoms`, `medical_checkups`) support translations
- TimelineScreen and WeekDetailScreen now fetch translated content based on user language
- Automatic fallback to English when translations are missing

### 2. Food Safety Data ✅

- Food names, descriptions, alternatives, and category names support translations
- FoodGuideScreen displays translated content based on user language preference
- Category names and food descriptions properly translated

### 3. Fetal Size Comparisons ✅

- Fruit/object names and descriptions support translations
- FetalSizeComparison component displays translated content
- HomeScreen, WeekDetailScreen, and TimelineScreen all use translated fetal size data

### 4. Translation Coverage - COMPLETE ✅
