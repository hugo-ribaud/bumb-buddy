## Current Focus

Internationalization (i18n) implementation phase completed. The app now supports multiple languages with a robust i18n system, including English, Spanish, and French translations. Right-to-left (RTL) layout support has been added to prepare for future language additions.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix Supabase/Expo build error (Node.js dependency workaround)
2. ✅ Update environment variable handling and Babel config
3. ✅ Confirm Supabase client configuration for Expo
4. ✅ Enable and test Supabase Realtime
5. ✅ Finalize and document backend schema
6. ✅ Update memory-bank files for foundation completion
7. ✅ Implement internationalization (i18n) support
8. ⬜ Begin core feature implementation (Phase 2)

## Current Development Priorities

1. Prepare for Phase 2 core features development
2. Begin implementation of the food safety database
3. Set up testing framework for UI components

## Recent Decisions

- Implemented comprehensive i18n system with i18next and react-i18next
- Added RTL support with a context provider and specialized components
- Created translation files for English, Spanish, and French
- Implemented a test utility for validating translations
- Updated all screens to use translation keys instead of hardcoded text
- Added DirectionalView component for RTL-aware layouts

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring all UI components work correctly with RTL layouts
- Planning for efficient implementation of food safety database
- Ensuring the database schema will accommodate all planned features
- Preparing for offline-first functionality in core features

## Current Mode

EXECUTE: Moving from i18n implementation to core feature development, starting with food safety database
