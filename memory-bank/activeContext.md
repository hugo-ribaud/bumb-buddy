## Current Focus

**Translation System Enhancement for Supabase Data - FULLY COMPLETED**: Successfully implemented comprehensive translation support for all data fetched from Supabase. The app now has a complete i18n infrastructure with support for English, Spanish, and French, including both UI elements and database content. All components are language-aware and automatically refetch data when the user switches languages. **ALL 40 pregnancy weeks now have complete translations in Spanish and French**, and the service has been fixed to handle missing translations gracefully with proper fallback to English.

**Next Priority: Performance Optimization and Secondary Features**: Focus is now shifting to performance optimization, UI/UX refinement, and beginning development of secondary features like appointment scheduling, push notifications, and enhanced functionality.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix Supabase/Expo build error (Node.js dependency workaround)
2. ✅ Update environment variable handling and Babel config
3. ✅ Confirm Supabase client configuration for Expo
4. ✅ Enable and test Supabase Realtime
5. ✅ Finalize and document backend schema
6. ✅ Update memory-bank files for foundation completion
7. ✅ Implement internationalization (i18n) support
8. ✅ Implement food safety database
9. ✅ Implement pregnancy timeline tracker
10. ✅ Develop basic health tracking features
    - ✅ Contraction tracking/timer functionality
    - ✅ Blood pressure tracking
    - ✅ Mood tracking
    - ✅ Sleep tracking
    - ✅ Exercise tracking
11. ✅ Create user profile management
    - ✅ Add database trigger for auth.users to public.users sync
    - ✅ Implement theme persistence in both AsyncStorage and database
    - ✅ Add language preference saving to database
    - ✅ Improve profile screen with realtime updates
12. ✅ Improve UI styling and dark mode compatibility
    - ✅ Fix language flag styling in dark mode
    - ✅ Convert StyleSheet components to NativeWind
13. ✅ Implement offline functionality foundation
14. ✅ **Complete Supabase data translation system** (COMPLETED)
    - ✅ Updated Redux slices to be language-aware
    - ✅ Modified all components to use language from LanguageContext
    - ✅ Implemented automatic data refetch when language changes
    - ✅ Ensured proper fallback to English when translations are missing
15. ⬜ **Comprehensive testing of translation system** (CURRENT PRIORITY)
    - ⬜ Test language switching across all screens
    - ⬜ Verify fallback behavior when translations are missing
    - ⬜ Test with different user language preferences
    - ⬜ Ensure proper cache invalidation when language changes

## Current Development Priorities

1. ✅ Food safety database implementation
2. ✅ Implement pregnancy timeline tracker
3. ✅ Develop basic health tracking features
4. ✅ Create user profile management
5. ✅ Enhance UI styling and theme compatibility
6. ✅ Implement offline functionality foundation
7. ✅ **Complete Supabase data translation system**
8. ⬜ **Comprehensive testing of translation system** (CURRENT)
9. ⬜ **Secondary features development** (NEXT)
   - ⬜ Appointment scheduling and reminders
   - ⬜ Push notifications
   - ⬜ Enhanced content management

## Recent Decisions

- Successfully implemented language-aware Redux slices for fetalSizeSlice and timelineSlice
- Updated all major components (HomeScreen, WeekDetailScreen, TimelineScreen) to use language from LanguageContext
- Ensured automatic data refetch when user changes language preference
- Maintained proper fallback to English when translations are missing
- FoodGuideScreen was already properly implemented with language support
- All database content (pregnancy weeks, fetal size comparisons, food data) now properly translates

## Current Challenges

- ✅ **Database content translation**: RESOLVED - All content from Supabase now supports translations
- ✅ **Translation mechanism for dynamic content**: RESOLVED - Services and Redux slices are language-aware
- ✅ **Inconsistent user experience**: RESOLVED - UI and content both translate properly
- ✅ **Multilingual database schema**: RESOLVED - Translation tables implemented and working
- ✅ **Service layer language awareness**: RESOLVED - All services consider user's language preference

## Translation System Status - COMPLETED ✅

### 1. Pregnancy Week Content ✅

- All fields (`fetal_development`, `maternal_changes`, `tips`, `nutrition_advice`, `common_symptoms`, `medical_checkups`) support translations
- TimelineScreen and WeekDetailScreen now fetch translated content based on user language
- Automatic fallback to English when translations are missing

### 2. Food Safety Data ✅

- Food names, descriptions, alternatives, and category names support translations
- FoodGuideScreen displays translated content based on user language preference
- Category names and food descriptions properly translated

### 3. Fetal Size Comparisons ✅

- Fruit/object names and descriptions support translations
- FetalSizeComparison component displays translated content
- HomeScreen, WeekDetailScreen, and TimelineScreen all use translated fetal size data

### 4. Translation Coverage - COMPLETE ✅

- ✅ UI labels, buttons, navigation
- ✅ Form placeholders and validation messages
- ✅ Error messages and status indicators
- ✅ Database content (pregnancy weeks, foods, categories, fetal sizes)
- ✅ Dynamic content from Supabase
