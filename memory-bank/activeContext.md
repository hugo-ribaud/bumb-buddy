## Current Focus

Pregnancy timeline tracker implementation completed. The app now features a comprehensive week-by-week pregnancy guide with detailed information for all 40 weeks of pregnancy. The timeline includes fetal development details, maternal changes, tips, nutrition advice, common symptoms, and medical checkups for each week. Users can browse through weeks organized by trimester and see their current week based on their due date.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix Supabase/Expo build error (Node.js dependency workaround)
2. ✅ Update environment variable handling and Babel config
3. ✅ Confirm Supabase client configuration for Expo
4. ✅ Enable and test Supabase Realtime
5. ✅ Finalize and document backend schema
6. ✅ Update memory-bank files for foundation completion
7. ✅ Implement internationalization (i18n) support
8. ✅ Implement food safety database
9. ✅ Implement pregnancy timeline tracker
10. ⬜ Develop basic health tracking features (Next priority)
11. ⬜ Create user profile management
12. ⬜ Implement offline functionality foundation

## Current Development Priorities

1. ✅ Food safety database implementation
2. ✅ Implement pregnancy timeline tracker
3. ⬜ Develop basic health tracking features (Current focus)
4. ⬜ Create user profile management
5. ⬜ Implement offline functionality foundation

## Recent Decisions

- Created a comprehensive pregnancy timeline database structure with 40 weeks of detailed data
- Implemented an offline-first approach with AsyncStorage caching for timeline data
- Developed a timeline service to handle data fetching, caching, and week calculations
- Created TypeScript interfaces for pregnancy-related data types
- Built UI components for browsing weeks by trimester and viewing detailed week information
- Added error handling for image URL parsing to ensure app stability
- Implemented a refresh mechanism to allow users to update cached timeline data

## Current Challenges

- Designing a flexible health tracking system that covers various pregnancy symptoms
- Planning the health tracking features to work seamlessly with the pregnancy timeline
- Ensuring consistent performance across different devices
- Maintaining type safety across the growing codebase
- Planning for comprehensive testing strategy for all features

## Current Mode

EXECUTE: Moving to the next core feature implementation after completing the pregnancy timeline tracker

## Team Allocation

- Project setup and architecture: Completed
- UI/UX design: In progress
- Backend development: Schema implemented, Realtime enabled
- Feature development: Food safety database and pregnancy timeline completed, moving to health tracking
- Testing: Infrastructure set up
- Deployment preparation: Not started

## Documentation Status

- Project brief: Completed
- Technical context: Completed and updated with implemented features
- System patterns: Completed and updated with data models
- Active context: Updated for pregnancy timeline completion
- Progress tracking: Updated to mark pregnancy timeline implementation

## Key Insights from Timeline Implementation

- Caching strategy is crucial for a good user experience, especially with offline support
- Using AsyncStorage effectively reduces API calls and improves performance
- Adding a manual refresh option helps users ensure they have the latest data
- Robust error handling for data parsing prevents app crashes
- Organizing weeks by trimester provides a natural way to navigate pregnancy information
