## Current Focus

Working on user profile management, data persistence, and UI refinements for the pregnancy app. We've implemented database triggers to auto-sync auth.users to public.users, added theme and language preference storage in both AsyncStorage and the database, and ensured profile updates are properly synchronized. The welcome message now displays the user's first name instead of email, with appropriate fallbacks. We've also improved the dark mode compatibility of language flags and converted several components to use NativeWind styling instead of StyleSheet for better consistency with the design system.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix Supabase/Expo build error (Node.js dependency workaround)
2. ✅ Update environment variable handling and Babel config
3. ✅ Confirm Supabase client configuration for Expo
4. ✅ Enable and test Supabase Realtime
5. ✅ Finalize and document backend schema
6. ✅ Update memory-bank files for foundation completion
7. ✅ Implement internationalization (i18n) support
8. ✅ Implement food safety database
9. ✅ Implement pregnancy timeline tracker
10. ✅ Develop basic health tracking features
    - ✅ Contraction tracking/timer functionality
    - ✅ Blood pressure tracking
    - ✅ Mood tracking
    - ✅ Sleep tracking
    - ✅ Exercise tracking
11. ✅ Create user profile management
    - ✅ Add database trigger for auth.users to public.users sync
    - ✅ Implement theme persistence in both AsyncStorage and database
    - ✅ Add language preference saving to database
    - ✅ Improve profile screen with realtime updates
12. ✅ Improve UI styling and dark mode compatibility
    - ✅ Fix language flag styling in dark mode
    - ✅ Convert StyleSheet components to NativeWind
13. ⬜ Implement offline functionality foundation

## Current Development Priorities

1. ✅ Food safety database implementation
2. ✅ Implement pregnancy timeline tracker
3. ✅ Develop basic health tracking features
4. ✅ Create user profile management
5. ✅ Enhance UI styling and theme compatibility
6. ⬜ Implement offline functionality foundation

## Recent Decisions

- Created database triggers to automatically create public.users records when auth users sign up
- Implemented theme persistence in both AsyncStorage and user profile database
- Added language preference saving to database profile
- Updated welcome message to use user's first name instead of email
- Established a system for syncing user preferences across devices via database
- Enhanced profile screen to respond to realtime updates from other devices
- Converted UI components from StyleSheet to NativeWind for consistency with design system
- Fixed visual issues with flag icons in dark mode for better theme compatibility

## Current Challenges

- Ensuring a seamless experience when switching between devices with different theme/language settings
- Handling edge cases in user profile synchronization
- Balancing local storage for performance with server sync for consistency
- Managing state correctly when user properties are updated from multiple sources
- Determining the right approach for offline functionality implementation
- Ensuring NativeWind styling is consistently applied across all components

## Current Mode

EXECUTE: Implementing UI refinements and styling improvements

## Team Allocation

- Project setup and architecture: Completed
- UI/UX design: In progress
- Backend development: Schema implemented, Realtime enabled, Database triggers added
- Feature development: Food safety database, pregnancy timeline, health tracking, and profile management completed
- Testing: Infrastructure set up
- Deployment preparation: Not started

## Documentation Status

- Project brief: Completed
- Technical context: Completed and updated with implemented features
- System patterns: Completed and updated with data models
- Active context: Updated with UI improvements
- Progress tracking: Updated to reflect latest implementations
- Internal documentation: all documentation related to the app can be found in /bumbbuddy/docs/

## Key Insights from UI Styling Improvements

- NativeWind provides a more consistent approach to styling compared to StyleSheet
- Dark mode requires special considerations for components with background colors
- Flag icons need custom styling to blend well with dark themes
- Converting StyleSheet to NativeWind improves code readability and maintainability
- Some third-party components (like Dropdown) don't support className prop and require direct style objects
