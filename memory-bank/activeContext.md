## Current Focus

Working on health tracking features for the pregnancy app. The initial contraction tracking functionality has been implemented, which allows users to time and record their contractions. This feature includes a timer, intensity rating, notes field, and a history view of recent contractions. The system is fully integrated with Redux and Supabase for persistent storage.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. âœ… Fix Supabase/Expo build error (Node.js dependency workaround)
2. âœ… Update environment variable handling and Babel config
3. âœ… Confirm Supabase client configuration for Expo
4. âœ… Enable and test Supabase Realtime
5. âœ… Finalize and document backend schema
6. âœ… Update memory-bank files for foundation completion
7. âœ… Implement internationalization (i18n) support
8. âœ… Implement food safety database
9. âœ… Implement pregnancy timeline tracker
10. ðŸ”„ Develop basic health tracking features (Current priority)

- âœ… Contraction tracking/timer functionality
- â¬œ Blood pressure tracking
- â¬œ Mood tracking
- â¬œ Sleep tracking
- â¬œ Exercise tracking

11. â¬œ Create user profile management
12. â¬œ Implement offline functionality foundation

## Current Development Priorities

1. âœ… Food safety database implementation
2. âœ… Implement pregnancy timeline tracker
3. ðŸ”„ Develop basic health tracking features (Current focus)
4. â¬œ Create user profile management
5. â¬œ Implement offline functionality foundation

## Recent Decisions

- Implemented contraction tracking with persistence via Redux and Supabase
- Built a contraction timer UI with start/stop functionality
- Added contraction intensity rating and notes capabilities
- Created a history view to show recent contractions with timing details
- Integrated the health tracking UI with internationalization support
- Developed an architecture that allows for easily adding more health metrics

## Current Challenges

- Designing a consistent user experience across different health tracking features
- Ensuring that health data is properly synchronized with the server
- Handling edge cases like app being closed during an active contraction
- Providing meaningful visualization for health data trends
- Planning the integration of health data with the pregnancy timeline for context
- Maintaining type safety across complex nested data structures

## Current Mode

EXECUTE: Implementing health tracking features one by one, starting with contraction tracking

## Team Allocation

- Project setup and architecture: Completed
- UI/UX design: In progress
- Backend development: Schema implemented, Realtime enabled
- Feature development: Food safety database and pregnancy timeline completed, health tracking in progress
- Testing: Infrastructure set up
- Deployment preparation: Not started

## Documentation Status

- Project brief: Completed
- Technical context: Completed and updated with implemented features
- System patterns: Completed and updated with data models
- Active context: Updated with contraction tracking completion
- Progress tracking: Updated to reflect health tracking implementation progress
- Internal documentation : all documentations related to the can be found in /bumbbuddy/docs/

## Key Insights from Health Tracking Implementation

- Redux integration is critical for maintaining consistent state across the app
- Local timer state combined with server-side persistence provides a good user experience
- Modal interfaces work well for collecting detailed health information
- Careful state management is needed when dealing with time-based features like timers
- Calculating time intervals and durations requires robust date handling
- FlatList component is effective for displaying historical health data entries
