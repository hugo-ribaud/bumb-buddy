## Current Focus

Foundation phase completed. Backend schema finalized with comprehensive database design. Preparing for Phase 2 implementation, starting with internationalization (i18n) support to enhance app accessibility and user experience.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix Supabase/Expo build error (Node.js dependency workaround)
2. ✅ Update environment variable handling and Babel config
3. ✅ Confirm Supabase client configuration for Expo
4. ✅ Enable and test Supabase Realtime
5. ✅ Finalize and document backend schema
6. ✅ Update memory-bank files for foundation completion
7. ⬜ Implement internationalization (i18n) support
8. ⬜ Begin core feature implementation (Phase 2)

## Current Development Priorities

1. Implement i18n infrastructure using i18next and react-i18next
2. Prepare for Phase 2 core features development
3. Set up testing framework for UI components

## Recent Decisions

- Implemented Metro config workaround for Supabase/Expo compatibility
- Updated Babel config to whitelist correct env variables
- Enabled Realtime for Users table with real-time UI updates
- Added Realtime service with subscription management
- Finalized comprehensive database schema with RLS security policies
- Decided to implement i18n as first step of Phase 2

## Current Challenges
