## Current Focus

Food safety database implementation completed. The app now includes a comprehensive database of foods with safety ratings for pregnancy, complete with filtering by category and safety status. The database is powered by Supabase with Realtime functionality for instant updates.

## Immediate Next Steps

1. ✅ Fix Supabase/Expo build error (Node.js dependency workaround)
2. ✅ Update environment variable handling and Babel config
3. ✅ Confirm Supabase client configuration for Expo
4. ✅ Enable and test Supabase Realtime
5. ✅ Finalize and document backend schema
6. ✅ Update memory-bank files for foundation completion
7. ✅ Implement internationalization (i18n) support
8. ✅ Implement food safety database
9. ⬜ Continue with remaining core features (Phase 2)

## Current Development Priorities

1. ✅ Food safety database implementation
2. ⬜ Implement pregnancy timeline tracker
3. ⬜ Develop basic health tracking features
4. ⬜ Create user profile management
5. ⬜ Implement offline functionality foundation

## Recent Decisions

- Created a comprehensive food safety database structure with categories and detailed food info
- Implemented TypeScript interfaces for food-related data types
- Developed a service layer for accessing the food database
- Updated UI with category filtering and safety rating indicators
- Set up Supabase Realtime for food data to enable live updates
- Seeded the database with 9 categories and 45 food items with safety information

## Current Challenges

- Developing the remaining core features with proper offline support
- Ensuring consistent performance across different devices
- Maintaining type safety across the growing codebase
- Planning for comprehensive testing strategy for all features

## Current Mode

EXECUTE: Moving to the next core feature implementation after completing the food safety database
